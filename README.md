# PlanetoidStation13
The github repository for PlanetoidStation13, a Space Station 13 themed Barotrauma mod / server.

# Notice

The ETCFiles folder + Characters contains copyrighted material, I cannot change this as it is music to be used in game as Barotrauma doesn't support native playing of external music files, and a lua mod for the such has also not been made.

Planetoid 13 is not using these for profit or income, and once a way to play these without having them in the files is found or made, it will be changed.
